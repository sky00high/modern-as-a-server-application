Addition Parts:
Considering that in this project, the correlations among data objects are not very close, we decided to use NoSQL database. And we chose Amazon DynamoDB in this project, it is fast, flexible and easy to use.

For the time being we decided to deploy the app on EB, and then we will move static files to S3 when doing project 2, as suggested by our professor. The views and public folders will include front-end codes, while other folders and app.js will include back-end codes.
